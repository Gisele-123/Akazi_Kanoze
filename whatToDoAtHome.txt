In React Native, you can link different components together using navigation libraries. Navigation libraries allow you to create a stack of screens (components) and handle navigation between them. The most commonly used navigation libraries in React Native are React Navigation and React Native Navigation.

Here's a brief overview of how you can link different components using React Navigation, which is widely used and well-documented:

1. Install React Navigation:

First, you need to install the required packages. Open your terminal and navigate to your React Native project folder, then run the following command:

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack
```

2. Set up Navigation Container:

In your main application file (usually `App.js`), import the necessary modules and set up the navigation container:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import HomeScreen from './screens/HomeScreen'; // Import your HomeScreen component
import OtherScreen from './screens/OtherScreen'; // Import your OtherScreen component

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

const App = () => {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Other" component={OtherScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};

export default App;
```

3. Create Components:

Create the different components (screens) you want to navigate between. For example, let's say you have `HomeScreen` and `OtherScreen` components. Define these components in separate files and export them.

```jsx
// HomeScreen.js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const HomeScreen = ({ navigation }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Welcome to Home Screen</Text>
      <Button
        title="Go to Other Screen"
        onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Other')}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default HomeScreen;
```

```jsx
// OtherScreen.js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const OtherScreen = ({ navigation }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Welcome to Other Screen</Text>
      <Button
        title="Go back to Home"
        onPress={() => navigation.goBack()}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default OtherScreen;
```

4. Navigation:

Now, you have set up navigation between the `HomeScreen` and `OtherScreen` components. When you click the "Go to Other Screen" button on the `HomeScreen`, it will navigate to the `OtherScreen`. Similarly, when you click the "Go back to Home" button on the `OtherScreen`, it will go back to the `HomeScreen`.

This is a basic example of how to link different components using React Navigation. Depending on your app's complexity, you may need to explore more advanced navigation features offered by the library.
